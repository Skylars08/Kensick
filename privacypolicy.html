        of service of every site you visit.</p>

    <h2 id="PIIProtection">2. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
    <p>KENSICK discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
        employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process
        it on KENSICK's behalf or to provide services available at KENSICK's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to
        disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside
        of your home country; by using KENSICK's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.
        KENSICK will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to
        anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, KENSICK
        discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a
        subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when KENSICK believes in good faith that disclosure is
        reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of KENSICK, third parties or the public at large.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered user of http://www.kensick.com and have supplied your email address, KENSICK may
        occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to
        date with what's going on with KENSICK and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of
        information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
        support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us
        clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. KENSICK takes all measures reasonably
        necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

    <h2 id="Ecommerce">3. E-commerce</h2>
    <p>Those who engage in transactions with KENSICK â€“ by purchasing KENSICK's services or products, are asked to
        provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to
        process those transactions. In each case, KENSICK collects such information only insofar as is necessary or
        appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with KENSICK. KENSICK does not disclose
        personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply
        personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
        website-related activities.</p>

    <h2 id="businesstransfers">4. Business Transfers</h2>
    <p>If KENSICK, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that KENSICK goes out of
        business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
        third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of KENSICK may continue to use
        your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

        KENSICK's sole discretion. KENSICK encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its
